OBSERVATIONS/NOTES
	
	remove/modify loansEligibilty to DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
	You can have a field for Address in Members table
	PhoneNo and IDNumbers are not ints but varchar(20) ( You wont be able to store data starting with zeros using ints)
	CHANGE IdNo to IdNo VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE;
	
	*PhoneNo VARCHAR
	ENUM FIELDS ( NOT SURE WHICH DB your using but ENUMS should contain values Eg MembershipStatus ENUM('ACTIVE','WITHDRAWN','DORMANT','SUSPENDED') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'ACTIVE')
	
	In table SavingsAccounts Member can have multiple accounts so... UNIQUE KEY(memId,AccountNo) ( for faster searches and joins)
	In table Loans add column InterestRate ( maybe later when project grows)
	Table Loans Member can have multiple Loans so PRIMARY KEY IS Loanid and add UNIQUE KEY (memid,LoanId) ( for faster searches and joins)
	Table Documents : single member can have multiple documents so PRIMARY KEY is DocID add unique key (memid,DocID)
	
	
	Savings Account Balance Shouldnt be in Members Details but in SavingsTable
	
	For money fields use DOUBLE(15,2) or DOUBLE(20,3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 instead of floats
	
	LastTransactionDate USE DATETIME datatype
	In table transactions remove memid, just use AccountNo . You'll be able to do a join to Savings Account to get the memid ( reduce redundancy)
	
	Same for table Payments, remove memid and account no. You'll be able to get member details by joining Payments to Loans then Loans to MemberDetails
	Table Loans Add RepaymentPeriod int not null default 1, also add InstallmentAmount DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
	
	As the project advances add table LoanTypes with LoanTypeID UNIQUE,MaxLoanAmount,RepaymentPeriod,InterestRate, add table Savings Type but later
	
	AccountStatus ENUM('ACTIVE','CLOSED','SUSPENDED','DORMANT') etc
